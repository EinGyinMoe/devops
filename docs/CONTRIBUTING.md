------------------------------------------

* A quick summary and/or background

* Steps to reproduce

  * Make sure your software is up to date.
  
  * Search github issues to see whether your bug has already been reported.

  * Proceed to the next steps for details and be specific & verbose.

  * Make a sample code if you can &  give more information rather than less..

  * Add an optional notes section to describe your analysis and good decription is preview.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes that are corrective in nature and don't add anything generous to the usefulness or statibility, or test capacity of Rails will for the most part not be acknowledged.

### Summary 
-------------
* The first aim of a bug report is to let the programmer see the failure with their own eyes. If you can't be with them to make it fail in front of them, give them detailed instructions so that they can make it fail for themselves.
* In case the first aim doesn't succeed, and the programmer can't see it failing themselves, the second aim of a bug report is to describe what went wrong. Describe everything in detail.  Write down the error messages, especially if they have numbers in.
* By all means try to diagnose the fault yourself if you think you can, but if you do, you should still report the symptoms as well.
* Be ready to provide extra information if its needs it. If it didn't need it, it wouldn't be asking for it. 
* Write clearly. Say what you mean, and make sure it can't be misinterpreted.

Thanks!
